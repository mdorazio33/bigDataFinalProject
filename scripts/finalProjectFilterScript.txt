-- Query used in Tableau for creating a month-based filter
for time-based graphs using discrete data in Tableau --

-- I did not need to use this filter for my visualizations,
but I tested it in Tableau and found it quite useful --

IF MONTH([Arrest Date]) >= 1 AND MONTH([Arrest Date]) <= 12 THEN [Arrest Date] END
